# C - Preprocessor

1. What are macros and how to use them?
> In programming, a macro is a piece of code that is defined once and can be reused multiple times throughout the program. It is a way to define a shorthand for a block of code or an expression that is used frequently in the program. Macros are typically defined using a preprocessor directive in the source code, such as #define in C and C++ or macro in some scripting languages like Python.
